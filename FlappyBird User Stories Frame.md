**User Stories and Acceptance Criterion Frame**

**Title**: Each user playing DragonBird story gets a brief name   
**As a \[type of user\],**  
	•	Who is the user or role you’re focusing on? (e.g., player, admin, guest)  
**I want to \[do something\],**  
	•	What is the user trying to do or accomplish? (e.g., “save my game progress,” “choose a character”)  
**So that \[I can achieve a goal or benefit\].**  
	•	Why is this important for the user? What benefit or outcome will the user get from this feature? (e.g., “so I can continue my game later,” “so I can play as my favorite character”)

**Acceptance Criteria** (used to build the Definition of Done)**:**

 **Instructions for Writing User Stories:**

For each feature you want to create, write a new user story. After each user story, include two acceptance criteria that explain how you’ll know when that story is complete.

**Do this until you have 5 user stories** in total.

Make sure each story clearly describes:

* *Who* the user is.  
* *What* the user wants to do.  
* *Why* it’s important to them.

Then, for each story, list two specific things that must happen for it to be considered "done."
